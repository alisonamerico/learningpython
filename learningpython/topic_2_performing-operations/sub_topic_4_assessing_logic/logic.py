# Start a new Python script by initializing two variables with Boolean
# values for logical evaluation:

a = True
b = False

print( 'a = True' )
print( 'b = False' )

# Next, add statements to display the results of logical AND evaluations:
print( '\nAND Logic:' )
print( 'a and a =' , a and a )
print( 'a and b =' , a and b )
print( 'b and b =' , b and b )

# Now, add statements to display the results of logical OR evaluations:
print( '\nOR Logic:' )
print( 'a or a =', a or a )
print( 'a or b =' , a or b )
print( 'b or b =' , b or b )

# Finally, add statements to display the results of logical NOT evaluations:
print( '\nNOT Logic:' )
print( 'a =' , a , '\tnot a =' , not a )
print( 'b =' , b , '\tnot b =' , not b )
