# Breaking out of loops

The Python break keyword can be used to prematurely terminate a loop when a
specified condition is met. The break statement is situated inside the loop
statement block and is preceded by a test expression. When the test returns True,
the loop ends immediately and the program proceeds on to the next task. For
example, in a nested inner loop it proceeds to the next iteration of the outer loop.

## Hot tip
Compare these nested for loops with the nested while loops example here.
